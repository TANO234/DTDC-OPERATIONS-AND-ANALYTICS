Analysis of dtdc delivery performance and other stuffs

This DTDC Logistics Dashboard, despite being a simplified view, effectively highlights the operational pulse of the company. The core strength lies in the high On-Time Delivery Rate (Service KPI) and the dominant use of the cost-effective Surface mode (Volume KPI). However, the business is intrinsically tied to Cash-on-Delivery, which may present scalability and security challenges as volume grows. The biggest opportunity and immediate concern is the steep decline in total activity from June to July, which must be urgently analyzed to determine if it is a seasonal factor, a major loss of business, or a systemic data issue. The high distribution of shipments across all origins (as seen in the shipment overview) confirms a robust, national-scale network, but requires fine-tuning to identify the most profitable routes or centers.

SHIPMENT OVERVIEW (Top Center)Bar ChartShipment volume broken down by various Origins (x-axis) and distinguished by different Destinations (color legend).Decentralized Network: Volume is high but highly scattered across all tracked cities, showing no single, dominant hub.

On-Time Performance (Top Right)Pie ChartThe ratio of shipments that are "On Time" versus others (e.g., Delayed).High Service Quality: The vast majority of shipments are delivered "On Time." This is a strong operational KPI.

Payment Mode (Middle Right)Bar ChartShipment volume (or value) split by payment methods: Card, Cash, and Wallet.Cash Reliance: Cash is the most dominant payment method, followed by Card. The business is heavily dependent on Cash-on-Delivery (COD).

Total Shipments by Mode (Bottom Left)Bar ChartThe total volume of shipments categorized by transportation mode: Air Cargo, Express, and Surface.Surface Dominance: The company's core volume and operational focus are on Surface transport, indicating a strategic focus on cost-effective, high-volume logistics.

Total Volume by Origin (Bottom Center)Bar ChartThe total number of shipments (or value) for each major Origin city.Broad Contribution: Reinforces the main chartâ€”shipment activity is broadly dispersed with no single origin city acting as a massive outlier.

Monthly Trend (Bottom Right)Line ChartA time-series trend of the "Total" metric (likely volume or revenue) across January, June, and July.Critical Decline: Shows a sharp and significant drop in activity from June to July. This requires immediate investigation.
